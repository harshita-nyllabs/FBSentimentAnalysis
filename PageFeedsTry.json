Death had no time limit and if you look into our population today the young are going before the old. When i see these Go Fund Me pages it saddens me to see the situation these families are in. Im proud to say today that the people i educated on the importance of having Life Insurance took out policies and hopefully they will also spread the word and help prepare other people with a piece of mind. 😉😊",

This is an overseas company with an American name. If you think you can betray the life-long New Yorkers that work for you and still get away with pretending you're one of us, think again. I was born and raised in New York and have too much pride to invest a company that laid off hundreds of my neighbors and friends. These are people who have given you decades of their lives. They relied on you to support their families, their elderly, and to pay for college/medical expenses. You are devastating New Yorkers and their families and you are betraying those who trusted you. A true New York company doesn't treat New Yorkers like that. Let me ask: is it worth it? To save a couple dollars, you're lowering standards; you're cutting costs. As a result, we cannot trust you. And we will not be silent. We will tell people what you are doing. We will make sure that no one purchases insurance from you. You have lost our respect and our business. New Yorkers will no longer invest in you. And we will spread the word about what you are really doing to the New Yorkers you pretend to represent. Here's a suggestion: Remove the word \"New York\" from your title, because you have disgraced yourselves. Remove the word \"New York\" from your title, because you have embarrassed us.",
