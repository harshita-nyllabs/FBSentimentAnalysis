When I called to find out what happened to my money you could not answer my questions but agreed to send the itemized statement that I requested for my account. This was a week ago, and I was told the cash value was $200.00. After 18 years. I could have thrown my money out my front window an gotten a better return, as at least some of it would have stuck to my lawn. As I am trying to figure out the foreign language of insurance in all the paperwork you have sent me, today you sent another letter stating you cancelled my policy and there is no insurance or cash value. Thank you for siphoning off the last $200.00 of my policy. My agent does not ever answer his phone. Your latest letter says to call the customer service number with questions, but goes directly to an automated system.

I do not understand what has happened to New York Life.  I will never forget the love I was shown when my father was ill (my Corporate VP dropped everything to help me get home to go and see him in the hospital) until when he passed away a few years later and they rented a bus to bring my fellow employees to the funeral while numerous people from NYL showed up for the wake. As a current customer and former employee I am shocked in disappointed with NYL's lack of compassion for its long term employees who are the foundation of this company and made the company great.  Mr.  Mathas, I went to dinner with you and your wife in 2007/2008 (the united way silent auction).  I found you to be smart and what I thought was compassionate.  What happened?",

He wanted to ensure she would get the care she needed if he died before she did. He did. He paid 937.00 a year for 21 years, a total of over 19,000 dollars. \n\nNew York Life is keeping the premium payment for the year(s) 2015 and 2016. She used the policy and they paid claims starting in April of 2015! Her claim was activated March of 2015.\n\nShe is in memory care now and the policy pays 60 dollars per day. The problem is that there is a waiting period of 180 days. \n\nI don't understand how they can keep premium payments and pay out a claim at the same time! \n\nI have had numerous conversations with customer service, claims, and have even spoken with someone who is supposed to be a Vice President over claims and have gotten nothing but the run-around.\n\nYOU WOULD BE MUCH BETTER OFF TO PUT AWAY MONEY FOR ANY LONG TERM CARE NEEDED THAN TO PURCHASE THIS RIP-OFF POLICY THAT MAY NEVER PAY A CLAIM BECAUSE THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR AN ELDERLY PERSON ADMITTED TO A NURSING HOME IS FIVE MONTHS AND THE POLICY WAIT PERIOD IS SIX MONTHS!!\n\nBuyer beware!\n\nLearn from my family's costly mistake.

(San Francisco Echange coming up in April, at Galvanize).\n\nI am so excited to announce the first official LTB Exchange in New York City!  These are bimonthly gatherings of entrepreneurial and career-driven women designed to build local entrepreneurial ecosystems. Whether you are an established business owner, an aspiring entrepreneur, a professional or student, the LTB Exchange events offer the opportunity to exchange ideas, support and advice. While these events focus on Latinas, we INVITE EVERYONE to join us. These will be valuable learning and networking gatherings for all.\n\nEveryone will receive a copy of Nely Galan new book, titled Self-Made: Becoming Empowered, Self-Reliant and Rich in Every Way. The book will be mailed to you.\n\nREGISTRATION: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/latinas-think-big-exchange-in-nyc-registration-22474920091\n\nTO VIEW presenter's bios, click on link below photo image.\n\nOur formula is simple:  We invite a successful entrepreneur or entrepreneurial professional on stage for an \"Entre Tú y Yo\" chat exploring how they did it, who helped them, and their story.  This is followed by Q&A from the audience. Our featured guest is Tanya Menendez, Co-Founder of Maker's Row, a tech company that has received VC funding for its tremendous success and growth potential.\n\nThe second part is a presentation (mentoring pitch) from a local entrepreneur who needs advice from the audience. We follow the Kauffman Foundation model for these presentations.  Our featured presenter is Diana Hernandez, Assistant Professor at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and a real estate entrepreneur. You must come and hear her story...\n\nAnd, of course, we leave plenty of time for networking and community exchange.\n\nSpace is limited.\n\nWe thank New York Life Insurance Company for hosting this event and supporting Latinas Think Big!\n\n\n\nhttps://www.latinasthinkbig.com/event/latina-think-big-exchange-nyc/",

Years ago we, myself didnt think it was something to worry about, i personally thought it was just for senior/retirement people to worry about but as time went by and i had my first child 23 years ago and experienced some losses, young and old i knew it was something i needed to look into for the security of my family and of course to have a piece of mind. Death had no time limit and if you look into our population today the young are going before the old. When i see these Go Fund Me pages it saddens me to see the situation these families are in. Im proud to say today that the people i educated on the importance of having Life Insurance took out policies and hopefully they will also spread the word and help prepare other people with a piece of mind. 😉😊",

This is an overseas company with an American name. If you think you can betray the life-long New Yorkers that work for you and still get away with pretending you're one of us, think again. I was born and raised in New York and have too much pride to invest a company that laid off hundreds of my neighbors and friends. These are people who have given you decades of their lives. They relied on you to support their families, their elderly, and to pay for college/medical expenses. You are devastating New Yorkers and their families and you are betraying those who trusted you. A true New York company doesn't treat New Yorkers like that. Let me ask: is it worth it? To save a couple dollars, you're lowering standards; you're cutting costs. As a result, we cannot trust you.

He has a great deal of trouble with back and forth conversation and expressing himself so I became his guardian to assist him. We applied for the smallest coverage and he was accepted. When we called to make quarterly payment arrangements Mike asked the agent to speak with me. He appeared to be bothered that he couldn't speak directly with my son.As his guardian I would speak for him I explained.  Soon after that conversation  Mike got a letter asking him if he really applied or is there fraud going on! There was a paper to be notarized to make sure it was ok. We went to our bank and had that done and sent it back. Three weeks later he gets a letter saying that his insurance has been cancelled!\nWhat makes this discrimination toward my son even worse is, yesterday he got a letter from NYL asking him to increase his insurance by $5,000 for just a few dollars more. I am hurt as a mom, that my son can not be treated with respect and fairness.\nI'm sure this letter will be taken down but I wanted to speak up for Mike.",

It appears they don't like it if you are not dead!  My insurance agent wasted a week before sending me the surrender form by calling both my wife and myself saying that if I needed money I could borrow against the policy. Why would I want to do that? I just want to close the policy and collect the money. They finally sent the surrender form.  Isn't it in and two weeks later got a letter stating I had filled the form out wrong. No explanation and they d id not return the form! I called my agent who said he did know what happened to to fill out another form and tell the office to call him if there was a problem. A week later I got a new form. I filled it out exactly the same way, added the note to call my agent and sent it in. Nothing! I called the agent, he called t he company. The request was on somebody's desk. It would be approved and go out the next day he said. That was the 8th of August. It is now the 22nd of August. No Check! \n\nImagine what is going to happen if you die and wife tries t o collect on your policy. If NYLIC is lucky, he or she will die before they get around to writing a check. God forbid if your spouse needs the money to bury you. you may have to sit in the corner inside a trash bag until NYLIC gets around to sending you \"your\" money!\n\nI have two more $50K policies with these creeps!  On Monday I will begin the process to surrender them as well! I wonder how they will try to delay this time?",

If you don't understand finances before he dies, you are going to be at the mercy of uncertainty. I encourage you to educate yourself to understand basic finance. What you do not know about money can hurt you. If you don't have a \"what if\" plan, your plan is to let whatever happens happen. That just does not seem to be a plan that will let you keep enjoying the lifestyle you are accustomed to. Does it to you?\" \n\nI have helped many folks with a strategy that puts them in control instead of the uncertainty...

I did exactly what i was taught. Consistent council member & MDRT qualifier.\nMy name is Norman Boss & I was taught by the best. Mike Reeves, Earnestine Beauchem, Phil Hildebrand & Mark Koskovich. I began my journey July 2 1982 & it ended February  1 2010 due to disability. Every benefit i received  was driven by 1st year commission. I was trained skilled & educated by you NYLife to be a life  insurance agent which I did without  complaints by any of my clients. I was a damn good agent not to mention loyal to NYLIC blue. Now totally disabled  you turn your back on me in my time of need.\n\"The comany you keep?\" Really? 28 years devoted to that slogan & you turn your back on me. Integrity is defined as doing what you say you'll do. Where are you now for one of your own? I gave you everything I had to give until  physically I could give no more. I left nothing in the bag. \nYou choose to stand with unum a company with a reputation for cheating disabled policy holders out of their benefits versus one of your own? I can make this statement with a clear conscience because I'm  one of those policy holders  being cheated at the present time not only by unum but by the very company who trained me & that would be you NYLife. \n\"The company  you keep.\" Time to prove it wasn't a lie.

We applied for a policy upgrade from smoker to non-smoker over three months ago. We're very disappointed and so upset how slow the process is. I followed it up with the agent and she told me that the company is running a term conversion campaign and the underwriting department is prioritizing those. Do you normally ignore this kinds of applications because the premium would go down and the money you make will be lowered? My husband and I are so disgusted with the way you treat this kind of application. I am an insurance agent, too. I was with Metlife for 10 years and they process every application  as they come in. Customer service is super. By the way, i worked for New York Life for two years, too, but. I lost my inspiration so I left. I hope your underwriting department, management, and agent would pay attention to every concern a client brings up.",

We have been opposing a recent Resolution SJR007, (the transfer of Wild Horsea and Burros management, into state control - for lethal removal).\nI am writing you today, because of this recent legislative issue and a politician that you are funding, or have funded. You may have funded one of the following people - Chris Stewart, Mike McKell, or Evan Vickers. These people are promoting the lethal removal of Wild Horses and Burros and the privatization of America's beautiful lands. You should be aware of who you are funding, as they are going against the Wild Horse and Burro Free Roaming Act of 1971.\nOur Animal Rights Group along with 20K Equine Advocacy Groups, across the USA, have stopped purchasing products made by your Company and/or supporting your Company, for backing a Legislature who is carrying SJR007. We will not resume buying, or consuming your products, until you agree to not fund any of these candidates.\nWe are astonished that Companies like yours (that we have purchased products from for many years), have promoted such Politicians, that do not promote the best interests of the American citizens and our Wild Horses and Burros, as they are promoting the lethal removal of our nation's Wild Horses and Burros and are promoting the privatizations - of our beautiful public lands.\nThank you for your time and we do hope you will consider your company's best interest",

Is there such a thing?  If there is and it has been proven that the policy holder has less than a year to live how long must the policy holder wait on payments especially if the policy is in good payment standing? If the policy holder after three months of waiting falls a day behind in payment, but payment is made within an hour or two how much longer must a policy holder wait for their money? Sorry I have to ask these questions here, but I need to know this information not only for myself but for others that might themselves in the same situation.\nI will appreciated your answers and honesty on this matter.",

Because he was injured and could not work, he missed 2 payments before he died of accidental death. New York Life wouldn't pay the insurance because he missed 2 payments. They kept all of the money he paid them over all those years and I was left with nothing but debts. My car was repossessed and I couldn't afford my apartment. I don't want this to happen to other families. This is a disgrace. My three children suffered from this as well. So DO NOT give any of your hard earned money to this company.

We have been denied health insurance because we cannot legally claim the children as 'dependents'.   We want to adopt the children, however there is a complication with the adoption so we are on a one year waiting period.  Rather than let the children sit in an orphanage for one year, we opted to bring the children to America on a Student Visa.   Unfortunately, NYL has denied them coverage.  In December they asked us for various documents to show that the children were our dependents.  We complied and then we were asked for more documents.  Again, we complied.  We have sent passports, letters from Latvia (which had to be translated), letters from their school, letters from the adoption agency, birth certificates, etc, etc, etc.  Nothing was enough to show that these two ORPHANS were 100% our dependents.      We were DENIED (Denied from a company that is #8 in the nation for adoption assistance)   Then, two days later we receive a letter of certificate that the children are covered.  It's a miracle - I thought we were denied, so I contact the company to verify coverage and sure enough, they confirmed it.  I proceed to cancel the secondary insurance  we purchased for them ....only to receive new insurance cards without our other children's name.   We call and find out that there was a 'problem' with verification.  For. the. love. of God. WHAT????   I spend another 45 minutes on the phone with 3 representatives from Verification, Aetna and Benefits.  I was then told they saw the letter and they would research it, only to be called 5 days later that we need to turn in \"REPORT CARDS\".   Are you kidding me?      This is ridiculous.    What company, let alone an insurance company, New York Life Insurance Company,  puts a family who is trying to adopt two orphans through this type of hassle?",

            "message": "When I was working for my former employer, I took out a life insurance policy.When NY Life offered these policies to the employees, they said it made no difference what your previous medical history was. I questioned this on more than 4 occasions before signing up, not sharing to get into a policy and then have wasted my money. I have a history of severe COPD. Shortly  buying the policy, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I have not been able to return to work due to complications. According to my polo y, I have a rider that says if I am disabled, NY Life will pay the remainder of my policy payments the rest of my life. I did not find this out until I had already been disabled for a year. So my agent told my they would retro pay me the policy payments I had already made, and then pay the rest. That was until the big wig New Yorkers got a hold of it and found out they might have to pay out a rider. So they have denied paying me, because 2 months before I bought the policy, I was in the hospital. But I thought that didn't matter? OH NO. They will find anything in the fine print to justify not paying a policy.  So here I am, a disabled widow, on Social Security Disability, which isn't much, and they prey on the people who they think won't fight back. Well, I would just like you, John Q Public, to know what kind of insurance trap NY Life is.",

If I had taken that same $75 per month and put into a mutual fund back I would have more than enough. But NO, I trusted New York Life to be there like they promised. I just made another quarterly premium payment and it might as well be my last. New York Life has been ripping me off since 1986 and it’s time to call it quits. $24,000+ New York Life/ $0 Me.

I was contacted by Regina Caudill, Ethics and Compliance Department, Cincinnati office.  She contacted me by phone and assured me my voice was being heard and NY Life was interested in an amicable solution.  I was assured repeatedly between early May and late September, by both Ms. Caudill and her supervisor, Mr. Jacob Robertson, that resolution was very near.  Each time I expected an equitable solution to be iminent, they punted, often asking for information I already provided months earlier.  Despite receipts provided for over $400 in direct expenses and a request for $1000 in indirect expenses related to my treatment, I have not received a penny in restitution. If this is the way the Ethics and Compliance department acts, should anyone from this organization be trusted?  Still waiting for restitution after over 5 months...",

            "message": "After reporting an ethics issue at the Dayton New York Life office to the higher headquarters in Cincinnati, I was told to turn in my letter of resignation.  The narrative is below.  I have emails that support my story.\n\nIn February, I received a phone call from \"Karen\" telling me Tim Francis, a partner of New York Life was looking for managers to place in his Dayton, Ohio office location.  I agreed to an interview.\n\nI met Tim Francis for a face-to-face a few days later.  He told me that the manager position for which I was supposedly applying would only become available after I learned the ropes as a commissioned salesperson.  I explained to him that my current situation would make it difficult to work on commission only for an extended period of time, especially since I was new to the area and had a limited number of personal contacts.  Mr. Francis told me not to worry; he could see I was an experienced manager (retired military) and he would do his best to help me make the conversion from sales to management in about 6 months. Further, Mr. Francis told me when I made the transition, my base salary would be $75,000, but bonuses and incentives would bring the total closer to $110,000.00.  I assume he told me this because he asked me about my previous salary in Washington, DC, which was $107,000.00.  He went so far as to show me the plush office he wished to give me in a few months.  Oddly, he interspersed his false claims with Bible quotes, and kept an open Bible on his desk while telling me things he knew were not true. Ironically, I noted the Bible was open to 1st Corinthians...the book where the Apostle Paul takes the Christians at Corinth to task for their lack of a Christian testimony. Unaware of the deception, I agreed to work for NY Life, pay for my own prerequisite pre-licensing training, certification and license fees, and jump through the administrative hoops (finger prints, background checks, etc.), and burn gas driving the 76 miles to and from the  training in Cincinnati, conducted for new NY Life agents. \n\nIn training at Dayton, it was revealed to me and other agents-in-training by \"Anthony\" from Springboro, Ohio, that it would take three years to make the transition from new sales agent to a salaried management position.  Further, Anthony notified us the base salary was more like $20,000 with bonuses, and that the base salary decreased over three years, under the assumption that we'd earn more off our teams as they grew.  I turned to another new agent, Bob Hanson, and told him what Tim Francis told me, as opposed to what we were now being told in training.  Bob told me Tim Francis had told him the same story I was given.  Further training in Cincinnati, conducted by Brian Burger on 14 April 2014, seemed to confirm that Mr. Francis had lied. On 16 April 2014, active New York Life agent Ronald Thompson told me he had heard other agents had voiced similar complaints. He said that if I ever had doubts about “the real deal” he would always be straight with me. I deeply appreciated that.\n\nHowever, I became increasingly upset over Mr. Francis ethics lapse. On 16 April 2014, via email, I notified the professional development trainer, Brian Burger, at the Cincinnati NY Life HQ.  This was followed by a phone call that evening. Mr. Burger said I did the right thing calling him. He agreed the information Tim Francis put out wasn't right, but needed to discuss the matter with the Cincinnati managing partner, Ben Holman. He said he would call me back in 30 minutes.  He did not.\n\nOn Monday, 21 April 2014, we had training in Cincinnati again.  After class, I quietly went to Mr. Burger and asked him what Mr. Holman had said.  He only told me that Mr. Holman shared my concerns, but I had to decide for myself whether I would be willing to try working on commission much longer than 6 months and without the hope of a $75,000.00 salary if I converted to manager in three years.  Having invested two months into the process, I told him I would work very hard to make it work; my concern was I would be working with Mr. Francis on my appointments. I wanted some assurance Mr. Francis wouldn't say whatever was necessary to close the sale, as he did with me during the recruitment process.  Mr. Burger told me sales are closely watched and it shouldn't be a problem.  So, I said I would press on and do my best. Mr. Burger seemed happy with that.\n\nAfter training that night I returned a call I had missed from Tim Francis. I was told to report for training the next day, Tuesday, 22 April, at 9AM.\n\nWhen I came in to the Dayton office, there was no training, and no one there but Tim Francis and me. It was clear upper management had spoken with Mr. Francis, though he didn't say so. He told me he should have done more market research on me and that he probably shouldn't have taken me on because I did not grow up here in the Dayton area and my number of contacts was limited (all of which I told him during our initial interview). \n\nHe also said part of the problem was Columbus New York Life (Dayton's old HQ) did things differently than Cincinnati New York Life (the new HQ). Does that mean promising agent recruits that they could potentially be managers within 6 months with a $75,000 base salary plus bonuses and incentives was okay with one New York Life office and not another???? I could only wonder.\n\nMr. Francis asked what he should do with me.  I told him I was still willing to push forward.  He told me he now had his doubts as to my commitment and capability.  He then took me to his office and had me sign a \"Probation\" notification, telling me what I should have been accomplishing since I was declared a NY Life agent on April 11th (information I had not been given before).  He told me I was two weeks behind schedule. He just gave me my codes that day for portal access for professional development. Up until that day, I did not even have authorization for use of the phones in the office cubicles. \n\nMr. Francis told me I may need to work 60 hours a week.  I told him that I would do what was necessary.  He then sent me out to make appointments. Keep in mind; I had not even seen one agent go through the process of making a new appointment yet.\n\nAbout an hour later, I called him back with one confirmed appointment for April 29th, and two others who agreed to an appointment but I had no firm date yet (I was working on it).  Mr. Francis seemed excited and committed to helping me on the confirmed appointment.\n\nAround noon, I noticed I had a new voice mail from Mr. Francis, asking me to call him. I did.\n\nHe told me, \"I'm sorry, this won't work.  I'd appreciate it if you'd turn in your letter of resignation today.\" He said he'd be happy to refer me to another company. All of the objections I raised in our initial face-to-face meeting, which Mr. Francis assured me were not a problem over two month ago, were now insurmountable obstacles to my success. Up until this day, I never received one negative comment from Mr. Francis.  To the contrary, he was always telling me how proud he was of my progress.\n\nI called New York Life agent Ronald Jackson; I had been assigned by Mr. Francis to shadow him while he made his calls.  I told him I would not be in to work with him and explained my situation.  He was upset and offered to speak with management on my behalf.  I thanked him.\n \nIn the early afternoon, I received another call from Mr. Francis, telling me that Brian Burger, Ben Holman and he had all talked and agreed I should be let go.  I don't know why he felt the need to call me a second time to press the issue. He said to have my letter of resignation in by Friday evening (a change from later on April 22nd).\n\nA call and email to Mr. Burger right after that conversation went unanswered. \n\nI followed up with Ronald Jackson in the evening. He had not been free to follow up with Mr. Holman yet, and he apologized. I told him it might be in his best interest not to pursue this further, considering what happened to me. I asked him to let it go. I believe he did.  I will note, Ronald Jackson is the only person who really wanted to stand up and do the right thing.\n\nClearly, Mr. Francis does not want to work with me anyway, and he still has integrity issues that need to be addressed. I originally wanted to fight to stay, but I see the impracticality of that now. Hopefully, my \"voluntary\" resignation (I choke a bit on that) will not affect my ability to collect unemployment benefits. \n\nThis is not what should happen in an ethical company.  I did the right thing by contacting Mr. Burger regarding the false promises made to prospective agents. Mr. Burger said so himself. I reported a problem and am now being forced to resign. \n \n\nSincerely,\nRonald P. Sherrill",

New York Life Insurance Company has a rich history of being a great place for women to work, and the future of that streak seems bright. The history dates back to the 1800’s as they were the first company in America to hire women life insurance agents, and in the 1980’s they named the first female general counsel of any major insurance company. Since 2001, 11 times NY Life has been recognized by Working Mother Magazine as one of the 100 Best Companies for working mothers. Their dedication to women continues as they partner with #ALPFA to host this year’s Women of ALPFA Summit.

His preparation made the difference in my survival.\nI learned through my experience that our society is sadly ignorant of death.  We hide from it.  We ignore it.  We fear it and we fear those who are touched by it.  Every instance is termed a shock, yet it is the one constant in our lives after birth.   I want to help change that.

I called to find the reason why this happened and was told that someone called and gave a different address and a second check was issued to this address which is not mine, but no security question was asked from this person, all they gave was my name address and SS# which can be obtained rummaging through the trash, but when I call they always ask for my mothers maiden name which was not requested when this person called to change the address.

The salary for a starting manager is $75,000 annually, plus bonuses and incentives that should bring pay up to $110,000. The actually starting salary for a manager is approximately $20,000 and it decreases annually over 3 years as bonuses and incentives are \"expected to increase\" as team size and performance improves. Yeah. I think those qualify as whoppers. Within days of reporting the lies to the Cincinnati HQ professional development trainer, I was told I must turn in my letter of resignation.",

The senior sales force recruiter/manager there was making false claims (read as MAJOR LIES) to potential sales force recruits. I reported the ethics violations to higher HQ in Cincinnati last week. I was asked to submit my letter of resignation yesterday morning; the action apparently approved in Cincinnati. I guess it's easier to get rid of me than to fix their problem. I never even got a chance to complete my training or conduct an appointment. From what I've seen, New York Life is a good company, but the management in Dayton and Cincinnati leaves much to be desired. The really weird thing is, that same Dayton manager kept an open Bible on his desk, and would intermingle scriptures in his conversation while he would lie to your face, making promises he could never deliver. Ironically, the Bible was open to 1st Corinthians, where the Apostle Paul takes the Christians in Corinth to task for failures in their Christian walk and testimony.",

During the investigation there was a delay in getting the proper descriptors along with a current photograph of each child.

If you use AARP member services, like Life Insurance, it is contracted out to New York Life Ins. Corp. They offer you a seemingly reasonable rate, accept your application, write you a policy,...then began an immediate bombardment of mail, encouraging you to: 1. increase your policy! 2. Switch over to automatic payment deductions from your bank account each month! If you do not switch to auto-deduct, they deliberately delay sending you a bill, until very close to your due date! If you call to complain, they verbally harass you, saying you can avoid all this by doing \"auto-deduct\", or swearing you were mailed the bill, but something must have happened to it! They refuse to let you speak to a supervisor or dept. head,...and if you repeatedly call to complain,...they simply stop sending you a bill at all!!! Posting/filing a complaint with AARP gets you nothing more than a return e-mail saying that their \"special-resolution team will be in touch with you in 5-7 business days,...which never comes! Don't be duped into this horrible service membership club!!!",

The truth is that New York Life has only been there when a buck was to be made taking advantage of people in their greatest hour of fear.\n\nIs it just accidental that New York Life has made no public comment about the legacy of Nelson Mandela since his death just a few days ago.  Or is it that they would rather not call attention to the fact that New York Life at one time insured the lives of American slaves.  In a report to the California Legislature in May 2002 New York Life reported that its predecessor, Nautilus Insurance Company began writing life insurance policies in 1845 and sold slaveholder life insurance policies for approximately two years in the 1840's until the Trustees voted to end the sale of such policies in 1848.\n\nNew York Life stated that it abhors the practice of slavery and profoundly regrets that its predecessor was associated in any way with that contemptible practice for even a brief period of time. It went on to state that the fact that slavery was legal in certain parts of the United States during that time does not make it any less repugnant. New York Life stated that while it regrets this history, it understands the historical value of its archival records and that contributing to our society's understanding of the slavery era and helping people trace their genealogy are laudable objectives.",

If you send out notification letters then people are able to rectify the problem. Also if the policy holder is extremely ill or dying then a payment may have slipped through the cracks. Sending out a notification of a missed payment will alert relatives and partners that there is an issue and thus the payment can be made. It really is just common sense and your refusal to pay out on an insurance policy because of a missed payment by a dying woman after a lifetime of paying your company for a service is just appalling.

What is uncertain is the best path to recommend to garner these benefits. \n \nOver the past decade business owners have been overwhelmed by a plethora of choices designed to reduce the cost of providing employee benefits while increasing their own retirement savings. The solutions ranged from traditional pension and profit sharing plans to more advanced strategies. \n \nSome strategies, such as IRS section 419 and 412(i) plans, used life insurance as vehicles to bring about benefits. Unfortunately, the high life insurance commissions (often 90% of the contribution, or more) fostered an environment that led to aggressive and noncompliant plans. \n \nThe result has been thousands of audits and an IRS task force seeking out tax shelter promotion. For unknowing clients, the tax consequences are enormous. For their accountant advisors, the liability may be equally extreme. \n \nRecently, there has been an explosion in the marketing of a financial product called Captive Insurance. These so called “Captives” are typically small insurance companies designed to insure the risks of an individual business under IRS code section 831(b). When properly designed, a business can make tax-deductible premium payments to a related-party insurance company. Depending on circumstances, underwriting profits, if any, can be paid out to the owners as dividends, and profits from liquidation of the company may be taxed as capital gains. \n \nWhile captives can be a great cost saving tool, they also are expensive to build and manage. Also, captives are allowed to garner tax benefits because they operate as real insurance companies. Advisors and business owners who misuse captives or market them as estate planning tools, asset protection vehicles, tax deferral or other benefits not related to the true business purpose of an insurance company face grave regulatory and tax consequences. \n \nA recent concern is the integration of small captives with life insurance policies. Small captives under section 831(b) have no statutory authority to deduct life premiums. Also, if a small captive uses life insurance as an investment, the cash value of the life policy can be taxable at corporate rates, and then will be taxable again when distributed.  The consequence of this double taxation is to devastate the efficacy of the life insurance, and it extends serious liability to any accountant who recommends the plan or even signs the tax return of the business that pays premiums to the captive.\n \nThe IRS is aware that several large insurance companies are promoting their life insurance policies as investments with small captives. The outcome looks eerily like that of the 419 and 412(i) plans mentioned above. \n \nRemember, if something looks too good to be true, it usually is. There are safe and conservative ways to use captive insurance structures to lower costs and obtain benefits for businesses. And, some types of captive insurance products do have statutory protection for deducting life insurance premiums (although not 831(b) captives). Learning what works and is safe is the first step an accountant should take in helping his or her clients use these powerful, but highly technical insurance tools. \n\n\n\nLance Wallach speaks and writes extensively about VEBAs, retirement plans, and tax reduction strategies.

            "message": "Winter 2010\n\nIRS Attacks Business Owners in 419, 412, Section 79 and Captive Insurance Plans Under Section 6707A\n\nBy Lance Wallach \n\nTaxpayers who previously adopted 419, 412i, captive\ninsurance or Section 79 plans are in big trouble.\n\nIn recent years, the IRS has identified many of these arrangements as abusive devices to funnel tax deductible dollars to shareholders and classified these arrangements as listed transactions.\" These plans were sold by insurance agents, financial planners, accountants and attorneys seeking large life insurance commissions. In general, taxpayers who engage in a “listed transaction” must report such transaction to the IRS on Form 8886 every year that they “participate” in the transaction, and you do not necessarily have to make a contribution or claim a tax deduction to participate. Section 6707A of the Code imposes severe penalties for failure to file Form 8886 with respect to a listed transaction. But you are also in trouble if you file incorrectly. I have received numerous phone calls from business owners who filed and still got fined. Not only do you have to file Form 8886, but it also has to be prepared correctly. I only know of two people in the U.S. who have filed these forms properly for clients. They tell me that was after hundreds of hours of research and over 50 phones calls to various IRS personnel. The filing instructions for Form 8886 presume a timely filling. Most people file late and follow the directions for currently preparing the forms. Then the IRS fines the business owner. The tax court does not have jurisdiction to abate or lower such penalties imposed by the IRS.\n\n\"Many taxpayers who are no longer taking current tax deductions for these plans continue to enjoy the benefit of previous tax deductions by continuing the deferral of income from contributions and deductions taken in prior years.\"\n\nMany business owners adopted 412i, 419, captive insurance and Section 79 plans based upon representations provided by insurance professionals that the plans were legitimate plans and were not informed that they were engaging in a listed transaction. Upon audit, these taxpayers were shocked when the IRS asserted penalties under Section 6707A of the Code in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Numerous complaints from these taxpayers caused Congress to impose a moratorium on assessment of Section 6707A penalties.\n\nThe moratorium on IRS fines expired on June 1, 2010. The IRS immediately started sending out notices proposing the imposition of Section 6707A penalties along with requests for lengthy extensions of the Statute of Limitations for the purpose of assessing tax. Many of these taxpayers stopped taking deductions for contributions to these plans years ago, and are confused and upset by the IRS’s inquiry, especially when the taxpayer had previously reached a monetary settlement with the IRS regarding its deductions. Logic and common sense dictate that a penalty should not apply if the taxpayer no longer benefits from the arrangement. Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.6011-4(c)(3)(i) provides that a taxpayer has participated in a listed transaction if the taxpayer’s tax return reflects tax consequences or a tax strategy described in the published guidance identifying the transaction as a listed transaction or a transaction that is the same or substantially similar to a listed transaction.\n\nClearly, the primary benefit in the participation of these plans is the large tax deduction generated by such participation. Many taxpayers who are no longer taking current tax deductions for these plans continue to enjoy the benefit of previous tax deductions by continuing the deferral of income from contributions and deductions taken in prior years. While the regulations do not expand on what constitutes “reflecting the tax consequences of the strategy,” it could be argued that continued benefit from a tax deferral for a previous tax deduction is within the contemplation of a “tax consequence” of the plan strategy. Also, many taxpayers who no longer make contributions or claim tax deductions continue to pay administrative fees. Sometimes, money is taken from the plan to pay premiums to keep life insurance policies in force. In these ways, it could be argued that these taxpayers are still “contributing,” and thus still must file Form 8886.\n\nIt is clear that the extent to which a taxpayer benefits from the transaction depends on the purpose of a particular transaction as described in the published guidance that caused such transaction to be a listed transaction. Revenue Ruling 2004-20, which classifies 419(e) transactions, appears to be concerned with the employer’s contribution/deduction amount rather than the continued deferral of the income in previous years. Another important issue is that the IRS has called CPAs material advisors if they signed tax returns containing the plan, and got paid a certain amount of money for tax advice on the plan. The fine is $100,000 for the CPA, or $200,000 if the CPA is incorporated. To avoid the fine, the CPA has to properly file Form 8918.\n\nLance Wallach, National Society of Accountants Speaker of the Year and member of the AICPA faculty of teaching professionals, Wallach is a frequent speaker on retirement plans, financial and estate planning, and abusive tax shelters.

            "message": "IRS audits and Lawsuits\n________________________________________\nApril 24, 2012     By Lance Wallach, CLU, CHFC\n________________________________________\n\n419 and 412i plans being audits, insurance agents sued.\nPRODUCERSWEB.com\nFor Smart Advisors\n\n\nGet Sued\nBy Lance Wallach Wednesday, April 8,\n\nThe IRS is cracking down on what it considers to be abusive tax shelters. Many of them are being marketed to small business owners by insurance professionals, financial planners and even accountants and attorneys. I speak at numerous conventions, for both business owners and accountants. And after I speak, I am always approached by many people who have questions about tax reduction plans that they have heard about. Below are the most common. \n\n419 tax reduction insurance plans \n\nThese come in various versions, and most of them have or will get the participant audited and the salesman sued. They purportedly allow the business owner to make a large tax-deductible contribution, and some or all of the contribution pays for a life insurance product. The IRS has been disallowing most versions of these plans for years, yet they continue to be sold. After everyone gets into trouble and the insurance agents get sued, the promoters of the abusive versions sometimes change the name of their company and call the plan something else. The insurance companies whose policies are sold are legitimate companies. What usually is not legitimate is the way that most of the plans are operated. There can also be a $200,000 IRS fine facing the insurance agent who sold the plan if Form 8918 has not been properly filed. I've reviewed hundreds of these forms for agents and have yet to see one that was filled out correctly. \n\nWhen the IRS audits a participant in one of these plans, the tax deductions are lost. There is also the interest and large penalties to consider. The business owner can also be facing a $200,000-a-year fine if he did not properly file Form 8886. Most of these forms have been filled out improperly. In my talks with the IRS, I was told that the IRS considers not filling out Form 8886 properly almost the same as not filing at all. \n\n412(i) retirement plans \n\nThe IRS has been auditing participants in these types of retirement plans. While there is generally nothing wrong with many of the newer plans, the IRS considered most of the older abusive plans. Forms 8918 and 8886 are also required for abusive 412(i) plans. \n\nI have been an expert witness in a lot of these 419 and 412(i) lawsuits and I have not lost one of them. If you sold one or more of these plans, get someone who really knows what they are doing to help you immediately. Many advisors will take your money and claim to be able to help you. Make sure they have experience helping agents that have sold these types of plans. Don't let them learn on the job, with your career and money at stake. \n\nDo not wait for IRS to come and get you, or for your client to sue you. Time is of the essence. Most insurance professionals need help to correct their improperly completed Form 8918 or to fill it out properly in the first place. If you have not previously filled out the form it is late, and therefore you should immediately seek assistance. There are plenty of legitimate tax reduction insurance plans out there. Just make sure that you know the history of the people with whom you conduct business. \n\nRemember, if something looks too good to be true, it usually is. Be careful. \n\n\n Lance Wallach, National Society of Accountants Speaker of the Year and member of the AICPA faculty of teaching professionals, is a frequent speaker on retirement plans, abusive tax shelters, financial, international tax, and estate planning.

Using delay and misinformation tactics to make sure your company gets her more than $8,000 premium. All she wanted to do was provide peace of mind for my deathly ill father!! Now, that he's dead she was trying to get back whatever was left of the premium she was entitled to. She followed everything you asked her to do. But, the misinformation from the Sales Agent about the process ended up her losing more than $8,000 of her money for benefits she didn't need!!! Do you train all your agents to be so clueless about the policies they sell to your costumers?!?! Are all your agents supposed to know nothing about their clients and their situation?!?! WORTHLESS!!

He sold my husband policies for my children , ages 8 and 3 yrs , and told him that we \" needed\" this policy as it was a great investment for our children's futures. To kind of look at it like a savings account gaining intrest, and that after 5 , yes (five) years , it would pay for itself and have a great cash value. \nHow could someone sell a life insurance policy to create an investment for your future? As it only pays upon death. \nNow we have wasted unnecessary funds, that could've been placed into a real savings account for them!\nWhy would someone mislead a \"client\" like so? Well... We were what he needed to get over his selling/ commission mark , as he was a newhire, and he was willing to tell anyone anything to put some money in his pocket! And on top of all of this, when I told him I wanted to cancel the policy, for multiple reasons(too many to list, mostly bc he was an uneducated agent whom never had any logical answers, other than, ill get back to you, and never doing so.) Then he felt the need to use social media to blast myself and my family, for ruining his paycheck! How can your employees get away with such ? Not to mention it was completely unethical how he went about this! Who can I contact of higher authority regarding this issue?",

I learned many things from dad, the most important being: customer service.  How I wish I could continue with this note and tell you how happy I am with yours.  On July 10th, I called in to surrender a policy.  The woman who listened to and assisted me was a professional.  That same morning I had the paperwork faxed to me, filled in/signed and returned with a very good promise of quick turnaround (do not conserve) as I am in an urgent situation.  I called in days later to find it had not been processed yet, but promised the check would go out in the mail on the 17th.  I called again today and was unhappily surprised that the check would not even be mailed until July 31st.  The person who took my call today sent an \"urgent email\" to the conservation team to hurry my business along.  When I asked about a turnaround time, she could only suggest I call back on Friday.  I am not a happy customer and, the urgency is now a few days hotter.",

If you want to know more about my services, I have put information below and here is a short clip of me doing a comedy improv workshop with Macy's here in New York. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qMd3Kr6He8&feature=youtu.be. In addition, I will be speaking about and demonstrating my comedy improv team building workshop at two networking events given by Smart Meetings Magazine: July 19th at the Ritz Carlton in New York and September 17th at the Turnberry Isle Resort in Miami.I’d love to connect with event planners in this group. Improv truly is a perfect team building activity as the old-timers and the new people at a company. Everyone can participate. Plus, it's a lot of fun. Thanks for your help!",

There were four of us that pretty much hung out together and Aldo [Arnold Bradford] had most likely the exciting life of traveling on foot Europe several times, and Australia.  Aldo took the four of us and a CPA down to Mexico to one of his condos and shared camaraderie with us.  That was my first and only time scuba diving near Cozumel.  It was awe-inspiring because it was like the earth was breathing when you were on the ocean floor and the currents would swing you back some 60 to 100 feet, at times. (A fish story there, perhaps.)  We all stayed on the bottom because staying in the little boat just got you sea sick.  I thank Arnold Bradford for his kindness.  I was never a traveler and truly appreciated his kindness.  It was good because my wife, at the time, understood we had to do the trip a week after our two weddings [one by the Judge in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands and the other by a cool spiritual man, on the beach near where we stayed. 2/9th and 2/11th.  That was also a great time because it was the time of my first purchase of a Chris-Craft mahogany 16' runabout with a Corvette/Chris-Craft block that had been worked on the deep end with the crankshaft and boring of the potential stroke through working on the pistons.  It was number one of I think 21 mahagony boats!  I am still a nut for those boats but believe those days are over, maybe?  Thank you Arnold, Sherry, and the rest of the crew that made our holiday an event to never forget.  I'll speak more about it, no doubt, at another time.",

Not only is he completely out of line, he also appears to be a pervert.  Please reconsider your ad placement, you can do better.  As the public becomes aware of your choice in advertising, you are going to gain a lot of very negative attention.  People paying for your service are in turn paying for you advertising.  Not too sure, the majority of is will be too happy about that.  Freedom of Speech does not mean there are no consequences for that speech.

The complaint I want to do is in terms of unethical practices of the leadership of Union  Local 6 which long ago ceased to represent the interests of the workers whom they represent. They have been dedicated to defending their own interests instead. This union retains 2.4% + $5 of the monthly salary of each member. Some of these funds are used for blackmail, bribery and living a life with all the luxuries and benefits. There have been many cases where the Union local 6 has defended business interests rather than member’s’ interests.\t\n I denounce this based upon my full 15 years experience as a member of the Union local 6. I have had the unpleasant experience of knowing sad stories of other colleagues who tried to deal with work situations using their legitimate rights. But when they didn’t accept any imposition, the machinery of the Union Local 6 comes into play with the companies who work together as a whole, through blackmail or excessive workload or direct dismissal. This “solved” the problem on the company side not the employee side. This way they have silenced any further complaints or protests to this dynasty that over time has corrupted and made the work for which they were elected a whirlwind of parties, celebrations, feasts, and so on,_ all this supported on totally unfair and anti-democratic elections and mechanisms to remain in their current positions for many further elections.\t\n For example, in the last elections held in 2011, elections were supervised and conducted by the same  Union local 6. They were judges and of course they were \"re-elected\" without any opposition. In my case, in the elections of 2011. I had the intention to participate in elections based upon the support of many colleagues who are forced to work under unfair conditions. These fellow  workers were eager to support anyone willing to fight for their rights, who knew their needs and suffered the same problems. Because of that attempt to participate in elections, I was subject to pressure, work overload, continuous supervising, moral blackmail and all sorts of adverse working conditions to the point that I was dismissed on October 30, 2011.\n There are many details that I am omitting right now, many injustices, state that. I was fighting exactly the same conditions back in 2008 when I tried to run for elections, and I was fired for no reason after long pressure and work overload. I was separated from the Union, prohibited from working  for two years, based upon absolutely non-existent arguments. Today, in  2012, I was fired again, separated from work,and accused for any non-existent reason; however, I tell my coworkers that I will not let up the fight. This is everyone's problem, and together we can make a change.\n",

This way they can spell out all the words and improve their Grammar and Vocabulary skills!!!! In some states some of our kids coming out of High School can't even read!!!!\n\nLet's challenge them to write a Letter every Thursday to some one of their choice!!!!! It could be our Troops, are some one in Prison, of a relative in another state!!!!! Let them pick whom they would like to write to!!!!! Let them pick a subject they know about to write about!!!! If it's a subject they know it would be easier for them to do it!!!! We could choose an Elderly Home and have some young people to send them post cards!!!!\n\nI remember when I was in the Navy and overseas how I felt when we had mail call and they called my name to get that letter from whom ever!!!! What a felling that was!!!!!!!!\n\nI believe this would help us too by improving our children's literary skills!!!! This is a Win- Win situation for us all!!!!!!!!!\n\nIf you like this idea Please pass it on to anyone who will listen!!!!!!!! Let me know what you think???? Post it everywhere and remember to........\n\nWRITE A LETTER THURSDAYS!!\n\n\nyou can hear Uncle Rudy Mon. - Fri. on     www.stlouisflo.com     from 12:00 noon - 4:00 p.m.  central time",
