I explained to him right then i am aware of the disparity in our benfits and i asked him to give me the policy i wanted if not dont.  I ask for a policy that would give my granddaughter enough income to start college she is 14 years old at this time.  He said it would cost me 75.amonth and it was being deducted from my payroll. and i was hurt on the job and i am disabled i took this policy out in 2010 and i just got a statement saying it is only worth 1900 dollars and i am livid i could of paid 75 x12=900. a year x4 years 3600.00 if i would of save it under the mattress i express to him how my parents and family members were taken advantage in the early years 2.50 a week for 40 years is worth 5200. and at the end only worth 500.00 so you think i didnt explain what i wanted from this company. i told how the insurance agent would come to the house every week.\nANd i am livid and upset you should get what you ask for and stop doing people of color like this.  I am not happy and wish i could get every dime i put into this policy be return.  So check it out and your policy.  WHo does that 100000. policy on a 14 year old.  not happy.  I asked my agent to call me and his supervisor no call as of today i contacted the main office on 2 of January and no reply.  Now i am going to put tis out there It is Nwew York life policy. So i called the customer service and said the surrender documents sent out on the 7th of January and i also told them dont take any more money out of my bank account.",
