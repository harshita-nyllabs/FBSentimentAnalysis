It appears they don't like it if you are not dead!  My insurance agent wasted a week before sending me the surrender form by calling both my wife and myself saying that if I needed money I could borrow against the policy. Why would I want to do that? I just want to close the policy and collect the money. They finally sent the surrender form.  Isn't it in and two weeks later got a letter stating I had filled the form out wrong. No explanation and they d id not return the form! I called my agent who said he did know what happened to to fill out another form and tell the office to call him if there was a problem. A week later I got a new form. I filled it out exactly the same way, added the note to call my agent and sent it in. Nothing! I called the agent, he called t he company. The request was on somebody's desk. It would be approved and go out the next day he said. That was the 8th of August. It is now the 22nd of August. No Check! \n\nImagine what is going to happen if you die and wife tries t o collect on your policy. If NYLIC is lucky, he or she will die before they get around to writing a check. God forbid if your spouse needs the money to bury you. you may have to sit in the corner inside a trash bag until NYLIC gets around to sending you \"your\" money!\n\nI have two more $50K policies with these creeps!  On Monday I will begin the process to surrender them as well! I wonder how they will try to delay this time?",

Over charged for over two years ONLY to be resolved after I stopped paying and a most wonderful woman in headquarters helped. Need a new agent to help me reinstate. Call Manhattan office , unfriendly help. Request a new agent who can help me reinstate.Was promised a call back and help. 6 weeks later still waiting. So what do you think? Is NY LIFE a scam? Do people actually die and get money back? Or have I just been throwing money away?",
