This way they can spell out all the words and improve their Grammar and Vocabulary skills!!!! In some states some of our kids coming out of High School can't even read!!!!\n\nLet's challenge them to write a Letter every Thursday to some one of their choice!!!!! It could be our Troops, are some one in Prison, of a relative in another state!!!!! Let them pick whom they would like to write to!!!!! Let them pick a subject they know about to write about!!!! If it's a subject they know it would be easier for them to do it!!!! We could choose an Elderly Home and have some young people to send them post cards!!!!\n\nI remember when I was in the Navy and overseas how I felt when we had mail call and they called my name to get that letter from whom ever!!!! What a felling that was!!!!!!!!\n\nI believe this would help us too by improving our children's literary skills!!!! This is a Win- Win situation for us all!!!!!!!!!\n\nIf you like this idea Please pass it on to anyone who will listen!!!!!!!! Let me know what you think???? Post it everywhere and remember to........\n\nWRITE A LETTER THURSDAYS!!\n\n\nyou can hear Uncle Rudy Mon. - Fri. on     www.stlouisflo.com     from 12:00 noon - 4:00 p.m.  central time",
