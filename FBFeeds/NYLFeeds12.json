I questioned this on more than 4 occasions before signing up, not sharing to get into a policy and then have wasted my money. I have a history of severe COPD. Shortly  buying the policy, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I have not been able to return to work due to complications. According to my polo y, I have a rider that says if I am disabled, NY Life will pay the remainder of my policy payments the rest of my life. I did not find this out until I had already been disabled for a year. So my agent told my they would retro pay me the policy payments I had already made, and then pay the rest. That was until the big wig New Yorkers got a hold of it and found out they might have to pay out a rider. So they have denied paying me, because 2 months before I bought the policy, I was in the hospital. But I thought that didn't matter? OH NO. They will find anything in the fine print to justify not paying a policy.  So here I am, a disabled widow, on Social Security Disability, which isn't much, and they prey on the people who they think won't fight back. Well, I would just like you, John Q Public, to know what kind of insurance trap NY Life is.",
