(San Francisco Echange coming up in April, at Galvanize).\n\nI am so excited to announce the first official LTB Exchange in New York City!  These are bimonthly gatherings of entrepreneurial and career-driven women designed to build local entrepreneurial ecosystems. Whether you are an established business owner, an aspiring entrepreneur, a professional or student, the LTB Exchange events offer the opportunity to exchange ideas, support and advice. While these events focus on Latinas, we INVITE EVERYONE to join us. These will be valuable learning and networking gatherings for all.\n\nEveryone will receive a copy of Nely Galan new book, titled Self-Made: Becoming Empowered, Self-Reliant and Rich in Every Way. The book will be mailed to you.\n\nREGISTRATION: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/latinas-think-big-exchange-in-nyc-registration-22474920091\n\nTO VIEW presenter's bios, click on link below photo image.\n\nOur formula is simple:  We invite a successful entrepreneur or entrepreneurial professional on stage for an \"Entre Tú y Yo\" chat exploring how they did it, who helped them, and their story.  This is followed by Q&A from the audience. Our featured guest is Tanya Menendez, Co-Founder of Maker's Row, a tech company that has received VC funding for its tremendous success and growth potential.\n\nThe second part is a presentation (mentoring pitch) from a local entrepreneur who needs advice from the audience. We follow the Kauffman Foundation model for these presentations.  Our featured presenter is Diana Hernandez, Assistant Professor at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and a real estate entrepreneur. You must come and hear her story...\n\nAnd, of course, we leave plenty of time for networking and community exchange.\n\nSpace is limited.\n\nWe thank New York Life Insurance Company for hosting this event and supporting Latinas Think Big!\n\n\n\nhttps://www.latinasthinkbig.com/event/latina-think-big-exchange-nyc/",
