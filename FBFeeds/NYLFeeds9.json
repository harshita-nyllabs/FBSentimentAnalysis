We applied for a policy upgrade from smoker to non-smoker over three months ago. We're very disappointed and so upset how slow the process is. I followed it up with the agent and she told me that the company is running a term conversion campaign and the underwriting department is prioritizing those. Do you normally ignore this kinds of applications because the premium would go down and the money you make will be lowered? My husband and I are so disgusted with the way you treat this kind of application. I am an insurance agent, too. I was with Metlife for 10 years and they process every application  as they come in. Customer service is super. By the way, i worked for New York Life for two years, too, but. I lost my inspiration so I left.

You may have funded one of the following people - Chris Stewart, Mike McKell, or Evan Vickers. These people are promoting the lethal removal of Wild Horses and Burros and the privatization of America's beautiful lands.

We will not resume buying, or consuming your products, until you agree to not fund any of these candidates.\nWe are astonished that Companies like yours (that we have purchased products from for many years), have promoted such Politicians, that do not promote the best interests of the American citizens and our Wild Horses and Burros, as they are promoting the lethal removal of our nation's Wild Horses and Burros and are promoting the privatizations - of our beautiful public lands.\nThank you for your time and we do hope you will consider your company's best interest",
