I learned many things from dad, the most important being: customer service.  How I wish I could continue with this note and tell you how happy I am with yours.  On July 10th, I called in to surrender a policy.  The woman who listened to and assisted me was a professional.  That same morning I had the paperwork faxed to me, filled in/signed and returned with a very good promise of quick turnaround (do not conserve) as I am in an urgent situation.  I called in days later to find it had not been processed yet, but promised the check would go out in the mail on the 17th.  I called again today and was unhappily surprised that the check would not even be mailed until July 31st.  The person who took my call today sent an \"urgent email\" to the conservation team to hurry my business along.  When I asked about a turnaround time, she could only suggest I call back on Friday.  I am not a happy customer and, the urgency is now a few days hotter.",
