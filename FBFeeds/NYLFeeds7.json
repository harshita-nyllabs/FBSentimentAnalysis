He has a great deal of trouble with back and forth conversation and expressing himself so I became his guardian to assist him. We applied for the smallest coverage and he was accepted. When we called to make quarterly payment arrangements Mike asked the agent to speak with me. He appeared to be bothered that he couldn't speak directly with my son.As his guardian I would speak for him I explained.  Soon after that conversation  Mike got a letter asking him if he really applied or is there fraud going on! There was a paper to be notarized to make sure it was ok. We went to our bank and had that done and sent it back. Three weeks later he gets a letter saying that his insurance has been cancelled!\nWhat makes this discrimination toward my son even worse is, yesterday he got a letter from NYL asking him to increase his insurance by $5,000 for just a few dollars more. I am hurt as a mom, that my son can not be treated with respect and fairness.\nI'm sure this letter will be taken down but I wanted to speak up for Mike.",
