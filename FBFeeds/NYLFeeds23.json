If you use AARP member services, like Life Insurance, it is contracted out to New York Life Ins. Corp. They offer you a seemingly reasonable rate, accept your application, write you a policy,...then began an immediate bombardment of mail, encouraging you to: 1. increase your policy! 2. Switch over to automatic payment deductions from your bank account each month! If you do not switch to auto-deduct, they deliberately delay sending you a bill, until very close to your due date! If you call to complain, they verbally harass you, saying you can avoid all this by doing \"auto-deduct\", or swearing you were mailed the bill, but something must have happened to it! They refuse to let you speak to a supervisor or dept. head,...and if you repeatedly call to complain,...they simply stop sending you a bill at all!!! Posting/filing a complaint with AARP gets you nothing more than a return e-mail saying that their \"special-resolution team will be in touch with you in 5-7 business days,...which never comes! Don't be duped into this horrible service membership club!!!",

            "message": "New York Life Insurance Company's current advertising campaign attempts to make you believe that they have played a major part in contributing to Americana as it relates to the history, geography, folklore and cultural heritage of the United States.  The truth is that New York Life has only been there when a buck was to be made taking advantage of people in their greatest hour of fear.\n\nIs it just accidental that New York Life has made no public comment about the legacy of Nelson Mandela since his death just a few days ago.  Or is it that they would rather not call attention to the fact that New York Life at one time insured the lives of American slaves.  In a report to the California Legislature in May 2002 New York Life reported that its predecessor, Nautilus Insurance Company began writing life insurance policies in 1845 and sold slaveholder life insurance policies for approximately two years in the 1840's until the Trustees voted to end the sale of such policies in 1848.\n\nNew York Life stated that it abhors the practice of slavery and profoundly regrets that its predecessor was associated in any way with that contemptible practice for even a brief period of time. It went on to state that the fact that slavery was legal in certain parts of the United States during that time does not make it any less repugnant. New York Life stated that while it regrets this history, it understands the historical value of its archival records and that contributing to our society's understanding of the slavery era and helping people trace their genealogy are laudable objectives.",
