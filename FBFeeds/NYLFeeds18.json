I called to find the reason why this happened and was told that someone called and gave a different address and a second check was issued to this address which is not mine, but no security question was asked from this person, all they gave was my name address and SS# which can be obtained rummaging through the trash, but when I call they always ask for my mothers maiden name which was not requested when this person called to change the address.
