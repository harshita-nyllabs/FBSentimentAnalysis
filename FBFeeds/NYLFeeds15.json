            "message": "After reporting an ethics issue at the Dayton New York Life office to the higher headquarters in Cincinnati, I was told to turn in my letter of resignation.  The narrative is below.  I have emails that support my story.\n\nIn February, I received a phone call from \"Karen\" telling me Tim Francis, a partner of New York Life was looking for managers to place in his Dayton, Ohio office location.  I agreed to an interview.\n\nI met Tim Francis for a face-to-face a few days later.  He told me that the manager position for which I was supposedly applying would only become available after I learned the ropes as a commissioned salesperson.  I explained to him that my current situation would make it difficult to work on commission only for an extended period of time, especially since I was new to the area and had a limited number of personal contacts.  Mr. Francis told me not to worry; he could see I was an experienced manager (retired military) and he would do his best to help me make the conversion from sales to management in about 6 months. Further, Mr. Francis told me when I made the transition, my base salary would be $75,000, but bonuses and incentives would bring the total closer to $110,000.00.  I assume he told me this because he asked me about my previous salary in Washington, DC, which was $107,000.00.  He went so far as to show me the plush office he wished to give me in a few months.  Oddly, he interspersed his false claims with Bible quotes, and kept an open Bible on his desk while telling me things he knew were not true. Ironically, I noted the Bible was open to 1st Corinthians...the book where the Apostle Paul takes the Christians at Corinth to task for their lack of a Christian testimony. Unaware of the deception, I agreed to work for NY Life, pay for my own prerequisite pre-licensing training, certification and license fees, and jump through the administrative hoops (finger prints, background checks, etc.), and burn gas driving the 76 miles to and from the  training in Cincinnati, conducted for new NY Life agents. \n\nIn training at Dayton, it was revealed to me and other agents-in-training by \"Anthony\" from Springboro, Ohio, that it would take three years to make the transition from new sales agent to a salaried management position.  Further, Anthony notified us the base salary was more like $20,000 with bonuses, and that the base salary decreased over three years, under the assumption that we'd earn more off our teams as they grew.  I turned to another new agent, Bob Hanson, and told him what Tim Francis told me, as opposed to what we were now being told in training.  Bob told me Tim Francis had told him the same story I was given.  Further training in Cincinnati, conducted by Brian Burger on 14 April 2014, seemed to confirm that Mr. Francis had lied. On 16 April 2014, active New York Life agent Ronald Thompson told me he had heard other agents had voiced similar complaints. He said that if I ever had doubts about “the real deal” he would always be straight with me. I deeply appreciated that.\n\nHowever, I became increasingly upset over Mr. Francis ethics lapse. On 16 April 2014, via email, I notified the professional development trainer, Brian Burger, at the Cincinnati NY Life HQ.  This was followed by a phone call that evening. Mr. Burger said I did the right thing calling him. He agreed the information Tim Francis put out wasn't right, but needed to discuss the matter with the Cincinnati managing partner, Ben Holman. He said he would call me back in 30 minutes.  He did not.\n\nOn Monday, 21 April 2014, we had training in Cincinnati again.  After class, I quietly went to Mr. Burger and asked him what Mr. Holman had said.  He only told me that Mr. Holman shared my concerns, but I had to decide for myself whether I would be willing to try working on commission much longer than 6 months and without the hope of a $75,000.00 salary if I converted to manager in three years.  Having invested two months into the process, I told him I would work very hard to make it work; my concern was I would be working with Mr. Francis on my appointments. I wanted some assurance Mr. Francis wouldn't say whatever was necessary to close the sale, as he did with me during the recruitment process.  Mr. Burger told me sales are closely watched and it shouldn't be a problem.  So, I said I would press on and do my best. Mr. Burger seemed happy with that.\n\nAfter training that night I returned a call I had missed from Tim Francis. I was told to report for training the next day, Tuesday, 22 April, at 9AM.\n\nWhen I came in to the Dayton office, there was no training, and no one there but Tim Francis and me. It was clear upper management had spoken with Mr. Francis, though he didn't say so. He told me he should have done more market research on me and that he probably shouldn't have taken me on because I did not grow up here in the Dayton area and my number of contacts was limited (all of which I told him during our initial interview). \n\nHe also said part of the problem was Columbus New York Life (Dayton's old HQ) did things differently than Cincinnati New York Life (the new HQ). Does that mean promising agent recruits that they could potentially be managers within 6 months with a $75,000 base salary plus bonuses and incentives was okay with one New York Life office and not another???? I could only wonder.\n\nMr. Francis asked what he should do with me.  I told him I was still willing to push forward.  He told me he now had his doubts as to my commitment and capability.  He then took me to his office and had me sign a \"Probation\" notification, telling me what I should have been accomplishing since I was declared a NY Life agent on April 11th (information I had not been given before).  He told me I was two weeks behind schedule. He just gave me my codes that day for portal access for professional development. Up until that day, I did not even have authorization for use of the phones in the office cubicles. \n\nMr. Francis told me I may need to work 60 hours a week.  I told him that I would do what was necessary.  He then sent me out to make appointments. Keep in mind; I had not even seen one agent go through the process of making a new appointment yet.\n\nAbout an hour later, I called him back with one confirmed appointment for April 29th, and two others who agreed to an appointment but I had no firm date yet (I was working on it).  Mr. Francis seemed excited and committed to helping me on the confirmed appointment.\n\nAround noon, I noticed I had a new voice mail from Mr. Francis, asking me to call him. I did.\n\nHe told me, \"I'm sorry, this won't work.  I'd appreciate it if you'd turn in your letter of resignation today.\" He said he'd be happy to refer me to another company. All of the objections I raised in our initial face-to-face meeting, which Mr. Francis assured me were not a problem over two month ago, were now insurmountable obstacles to my success. Up until this day, I never received one negative comment from Mr. Francis.  To the contrary, he was always telling me how proud he was of my progress.\n\nI called New York Life agent Ronald Jackson; I had been assigned by Mr. Francis to shadow him while he made his calls.  I told him I would not be in to work with him and explained my situation.  He was upset and offered to speak with management on my behalf.  I thanked him.\n \nIn the early afternoon, I received another call from Mr. Francis, telling me that Brian Burger, Ben Holman and he had all talked and agreed I should be let go.  I don't know why he felt the need to call me a second time to press the issue. He said to have my letter of resignation in by Friday evening (a change from later on April 22nd).\n\nA call and email to Mr. Burger right after that conversation went unanswered. \n\nI followed up with Ronald Jackson in the evening. He had not been free to follow up with Mr. Holman yet, and he apologized. I told him it might be in his best interest not to pursue this further, considering what happened to me. I asked him to let it go. I believe he did.  I will note, Ronald Jackson is the only person who really wanted to stand up and do the right thing.\n\nClearly, Mr. Francis does not want to work with me anyway, and he still has integrity issues that need to be addressed. I originally wanted to fight to stay, but I see the impracticality of that now. Hopefully, my \"voluntary\" resignation (I choke a bit on that) will not affect my ability to collect unemployment benefits. \n\nThis is not what should happen in an ethical company.  I did the right thing by contacting Mr. Burger regarding the false promises made to prospective agents. Mr. Burger said so himself. I reported a problem and am now being forced to resign. \n \n\nSincerely,\nRonald P. Sherrill",
