There were four of us that pretty much hung out together and Aldo [Arnold Bradford] had most likely the exciting life of traveling on foot Europe several times, and Australia.  Aldo took the four of us and a CPA down to Mexico to one of his condos and shared camaraderie with us.  That was my first and only time scuba diving near Cozumel.  It was awe-inspiring because it was like the earth was breathing when you were on the ocean floor and the currents would swing you back some 60 to 100 feet, at times. (A fish story there, perhaps.)  We all stayed on the bottom because staying in the little boat just got you sea sick.  I thank Arnold Bradford for his kindness.  I was never a traveler and truly appreciated his kindness.  It was good because my wife, at the time, understood we had to do the trip a week after our two weddings [one by the Judge in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands and the other by a cool spiritual man, on the beach near where we stayed. 2/9th and 2/11th.  That was also a great time because it was the time of my first purchase of a Chris-Craft mahogany 16' runabout with a Corvette/Chris-Craft block that had been worked on the deep end with the crankshaft and boring of the potential stroke through working on the pistons.  It was number one of I think 21 mahagony boats!  I am still a nut for those boats but believe those days are over, maybe?  Thank you Arnold, Sherry, and the rest of the crew that made our holiday an event to never forget.  I'll speak more about it, no doubt, at another time.",
