Just Google it and look at the expose done by 60 Minutes years ago. Based on my experience, things haven't changed. Policy holder for over 25 years, on disability since October and still dealing with them. They want additional information to support THEIR doctors possible finding that I should be able to work. WTH? I've paid over $20,000 in premiums over the years and I'm getting this type of treatment. You never know how things are going to turn out until you really need it. When I established this policy it was obviously to keep me from losing everything I own should I not be able to work. Never would I imagine that I would have to jump through so many hoops. I still have to pay premiums while they review the claim. Did I say…that I've been off since October 2013. DO YOUR RESEARCH!",

New York Life Insurance Company has a rich history of being a great place for women to work, and the future of that streak seems bright. The history dates back to the 1800’s as they were the first company in America to hire women life insurance agents, and in the 1980’s they named the first female general counsel of any major insurance company. Since 2001, 11 times NY Life has been recognized by Working Mother Magazine as one of the 100 Best Companies for working mothers.

She has been struggling to pay her insurance payment every month and still has paid it loyally for ten years. Just the other day at the ten year mark, she got a notice that her payments which were originally $52.00 per month just shot up to $288.00 per month because (they told her) after ten years her premium automatically increases. She was originally told her $52.00 payment was locked in 10 years ago by her sales rep. Absolutely disgusting!!! I always wondered what the catch was. \n\nFrom what I understand now is that she now has a choice to either pay $288. a month or change her plan to have higher payments for less insurance, or drop this new ridiculous payment and have no insurance. I am trying to understand why anyone would ever buy life insurance if it goes up to unaffordible amounts when you are less likely to be able to afford it and need it most. Isnt this equivelent to dumping your money down the toilet. Totally misrepresented...I was thinking the gamble was committing to the monthly payment and sticking to it for the rest of your life. \n\nHow terrible it is when you make sacrifices for your family for so long thinking about their well being and you find out it was all for NOTHING!!!\n\nREAD THE FINE PRINT OR HAVE AN ATTORNEY INTERPRET ANY COMMITMENTS SUCH AS THIS...CROOKS!",
