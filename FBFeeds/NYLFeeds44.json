Not only is he completely out of line, he also appears to be a pervert.  Please reconsider your ad placement, you can do better.  As the public becomes aware of your choice in advertising, you are going to gain a lot of very negative attention.  People paying for your service are in turn paying for you advertising.  Not too sure, the majority of is will be too happy about that.  Freedom of Speech does not mean there are no consequences for that speech.  As a business man Limbaugh took a risk and is now paying for it.  The free market is reacting.",

The complaint I want to do is in terms of unethical practices of the leadership of Union  Local 6 which long ago ceased to represent the interests of the workers whom they represent. They have been dedicated to defending their own interests instead. This union retains 2.4% + $5 of the monthly salary of each member. Some of these funds are used for blackmail, bribery and living a life with all the luxuries and benefits. There have been many cases where the Union local 6 has defended business interests rather than member’s’ interests.\t\n I denounce this based upon my full 15 years experience as a member of the Union local 6. I have had the unpleasant experience of knowing sad stories of other colleagues who tried to deal with work situations using their legitimate rights. But when they didn’t accept any imposition, the machinery of the Union Local 6 comes into play with the companies who work together as a whole, through blackmail or excessive workload or direct dismissal. This “solved” the problem on the company side not the employee side. This way they have silenced any further complaints or protests to this dynasty that over time has corrupted and made the work for which they were elected a whirlwind of parties, celebrations, feasts, and so on,_ all this supported on totally unfair and anti-democratic elections and mechanisms to remain in their current positions for many further elections.\t\n For example, in the last elections held in 2011, elections were supervised and conducted by the same  Union local 6. They were judges and of course they were \"re-elected\" without any opposition. In my case, in the elections of 2011. I had the intention to participate in elections based upon the support of many colleagues who are forced to work under unfair conditions. These fellow  workers were eager to support anyone willing to fight for their rights, who knew their needs and suffered the same problems. Because of that attempt to participate in elections, I was subject to pressure, work overload, continuous supervising, moral blackmail and all sorts of adverse working conditions to the point that I was dismissed on October 30, 2011.\n There are many details that I am omitting right now, many injustices, state that. I was fighting exactly the same conditions back in 2008 when I tried to run for elections, and I was fired for no reason after long pressure and work overload. I was separated from the Union, prohibited from working  for two years, based upon absolutely non-existent arguments. Today, in  2012, I was fired again, separated from work,and accused for any non-existent reason; however, I tell my coworkers that I will not let up the fight. This is everyone's problem, and together we can make a change.\n",
