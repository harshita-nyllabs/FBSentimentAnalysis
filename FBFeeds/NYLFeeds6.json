I have request forms to make change which again takes mulitple request and when I return the completed forms back to the agent or someone on his staff they do not take any action and I get noticed of payments not gettting made.  Since I have signed up with New York Life I can't get my agent to return calls or emails, it seems that all New York Life wants to do is get individuals to get in their retirement and life insurance plans then after that they can't be brothed to assist you unless you are somone who has a multimillions dollare account.",
