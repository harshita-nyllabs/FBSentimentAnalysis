We have been denied health insurance because we cannot legally claim the children as 'dependents'.   We want to adopt the children, however there is a complication with the adoption so we are on a one year waiting period.  Rather than let the children sit in an orphanage for one year, we opted to bring the children to America on a Student Visa.   Unfortunately, NYL has denied them coverage.  In December they asked us for various documents to show that the children were our dependents.  We complied and then we were asked for more documents.  Again, we complied.  We have sent passports, letters from Latvia (which had to be translated), letters from their school, letters from the adoption agency, birth certificates, etc, etc, etc.  Nothing was enough to show that these two ORPHANS were 100% our dependents.      We were DENIED (Denied from a company that is #8 in the nation for adoption assistance)   Then, two days later we receive a letter of certificate that the children are covered.  It's a miracle - I thought we were denied, so I contact the company to verify coverage and sure enough, they confirmed it.  I proceed to cancel the secondary insurance  we purchased for them ....only to receive new insurance cards without our other children's name.   We call and find out that there was a 'problem' with verification.  For. the. love. of God. WHAT????   I spend another 45 minutes on the phone with 3 representatives from Verification, Aetna and Benefits.  I was then told they saw the letter and they would research it, only to be called 5 days later that we need to turn in \"REPORT CARDS\".   Are you kidding me?      This is ridiculous.    What company, let alone an insurance company, New York Life Insurance Company,  puts a family who is trying to adopt two orphans through this type of hassle?",
