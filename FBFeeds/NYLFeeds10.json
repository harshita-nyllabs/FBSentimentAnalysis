Is there such a thing?  If there is and it has been proven that the policy holder has less than a year to live how long must the policy holder wait on payments especially if the policy is in good payment standing? If the policy holder after three months of waiting falls a day behind in payment, but payment is made within an hour or two how much longer must a policy holder wait for their money? Sorry I have to ask these questions here, but I need to know this information not only for myself but for others that might themselves in the same situation.\nI will appreciated your answers and honesty on this matter.",
