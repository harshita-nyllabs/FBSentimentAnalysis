He sold my husband policies for my children , ages 8 and 3 yrs , and told him that we \" needed\" this policy as it was a great investment for our children's futures. To kind of look at it like a savings account gaining intrest, and that after 5 , yes (five) years , it would pay for itself and have a great cash value. \nHow could someone sell a life insurance policy to create an investment for your future? As it only pays upon death. \nNow we have wasted unnecessary funds, that could've been placed into a real savings account for them!\nWhy would someone mislead a \"client\" like so? Well... We were what he needed to get over his selling/ commission mark , as he was a newhire, and he was willing to tell anyone anything to put some money in his pocket! And on top of all of this, when I told him I wanted to cancel the policy, for multiple reasons(too many to list, mostly bc he was an uneducated agent whom never had any logical answers, other than, ill get back to you, and never doing so.) Then he felt the need to use social media to blast myself and my family, for ruining his paycheck! How can your employees get away with such ? Not to mention it was completely unethical how he went about this! Who can I contact of higher authority regarding this issue?",
