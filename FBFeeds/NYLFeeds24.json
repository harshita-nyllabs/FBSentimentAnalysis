I'm currently stranded down in Dallas, TX attending a meeting that we've had here for a couple of days (Leaders For Life).  The weather has been VERY unusual for the Big D!  With that said, most flights out have been cancelled until Saturday.  Secondly, the company has taken care of all arrangements for those of us here at our training center to accomodate those of us that can't go home tonight as scheduled.  Lastly, I would like to express my gratitude to New York Life Insurance Company for taking care of its agents.  This is truly a first class company from the top down!  New York Life takes care of its policyholders and their employees.  The slogan, Keep Good Going isn't just a catchy marketing phrase that the company has come up with, it's truly the company culture!  I mean that!  A big thank you! ",

If you send out notification letters then people are able to rectify the problem. Also if the policy holder is extremely ill or dying then a payment may have slipped through the cracks. Sending out a notification of a missed payment will alert relatives and partners that there is an issue and thus the payment can be made. It really is just common sense and your refusal to pay out on an insurance policy because of a missed payment by a dying woman after a lifetime of paying your company for a service is just appalling.

You denied the family the chance to get more life insurance (they thought they were still covered) and didn't tell them off the status of their policy. And merrily took their premiums every month.
