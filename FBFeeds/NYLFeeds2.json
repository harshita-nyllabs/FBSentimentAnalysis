Since hospitalized children can’t participate in the fun, we decided to bring it to them by donating SoaringDreamBoxes, and SoaringQuilts and SoaringPillows decorated with inspirational messages and artwork.

I do not understand what has happened to New York Life.  I will never forget the love I was shown when my father was ill (my Corporate VP dropped everything to help me get home to go and see him in the hospital) until when he passed away a few years later and they rented a bus to bring my fellow employees to the funeral while numerous people from NYL showed up for the wake. As a current customer and former employee I am shocked in disappointed with NYL's lack of compassion for its long term employees who are the foundation of this company and made the company great.  Mr.  Mathas, I went to dinner with you and your wife in 2007/2008 (the united way silent auction).  I found you to be smart and what I thought was compassionate.  What happened?",

He wanted to ensure she would get the care she needed if he died before she did. He did. He paid 937.00 a year for 21 years, a total of over 19,000 dollars. \n\nNew York Life is keeping the premium payment for the year(s) 2015 and 2016. She used the policy and they paid claims starting in April of 2015! Her claim was activated March of 2015.\n\nShe is in memory care now and the policy pays 60 dollars per day. The problem is that there is a waiting period of 180 days. \n\nI don't understand how they can keep premium payments and pay out a claim at the same time! \n\nI have had numerous conversations with customer service, claims, and have even spoken with someone who is supposed to be a Vice President over claims and have gotten nothing but the run-around.\n\nYOU WOULD BE MUCH BETTER OFF TO PUT AWAY MONEY FOR ANY LONG TERM CARE NEEDED THAN TO PURCHASE THIS RIP-OFF POLICY THAT MAY NEVER PAY A CLAIM BECAUSE THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR AN ELDERLY PERSON ADMITTED TO A NURSING HOME IS FIVE MONTHS AND THE POLICY WAIT PERIOD IS SIX MONTHS!!\n\nBuyer beware!\n\nLearn from my family's costly mistake.
