I was applying for a salaried management position when in fact there were just \"commission only\" sales jobs. 2. If I met objectives, I could convert to a salaried starting management position in six months. The minimum time required is actually about 3 years. 3. The salary for a starting manager is $75,000 annually, plus bonuses and incentives that should bring pay up to $110,000. The actually starting salary for a manager is approximately $20,000 and it decreases annually over 3 years as bonuses and incentives are \"expected to increase\" as team size and performance improves. Yeah. I think those qualify as whoppers. Within days of reporting the lies to the Cincinnati HQ professional development trainer, I was told I must turn in my letter of resignation.",

The senior sales force recruiter/manager there was making false claims (read as MAJOR LIES) to potential sales force recruits. I reported the ethics violations to higher HQ in Cincinnati last week. I was asked to submit my letter of resignation yesterday morning; the action apparently approved in Cincinnati. I guess it's easier to get rid of me than to fix their problem. I never even got a chance to complete my training or conduct an appointment. From what I've seen, New York Life is a good company, but the management in Dayton and Cincinnati leaves much to be desired. The really weird thing is, that same Dayton manager kept an open Bible on his desk, and would intermingle scriptures in his conversation while he would lie to your face, making promises he could never deliver. Ironically, the Bible was open to 1st Corinthians, where the Apostle Paul takes the Christians in Corinth to task for failures in their Christian walk and testimony.",
