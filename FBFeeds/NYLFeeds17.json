            "message": "WARNING!!! My mother bought life insurance with this company NEW YORK LIFE. She has been struggling to pay her insurance payment every month and still has paid it loyally for ten years. Just the other day at the ten year mark, she got a notice that her payments which were originally $52.00 per month just shot up to $288.00 per month because (they told her) after ten years her premium automatically increases. She was originally told her $52.00 payment was locked in 10 years ago by her sales rep. Absolutely disgusting!!! I always wondered what the catch was. \n\nFrom what I understand now is that she now has a choice to either pay $288. a month or change her plan to have higher payments for less insurance, or drop this new ridiculous payment and have no insurance. I am trying to understand why anyone would ever buy life insurance if it goes up to unaffordible amounts when you are less likely to be able to afford it and need it most. Isnt this equivelent to dumping your money down the toilet. Totally misrepresented...I was thinking the gamble was committing to the monthly payment and sticking to it for the rest of your life. \n\nHow terrible it is when you make sacrifices for your family for so long thinking about their well being and you find out it was all for NOTHING!!!\n\nREAD THE FINE PRINT OR HAVE AN ATTORNEY INTERPRET ANY COMMITMENTS SUCH AS THIS...CROOKS!",

She has assisted in changing all of the clients doctors, and made the decision her client could not come home to her own home for whatever time she has left but made the statement to me the caregiver that she would Never come home again?

His preparation made the difference in my survival.\nI learned through my experience that our society is sadly ignorant of death.  We hide from it.  We ignore it.  We fear it and we fear those who are touched by it.  Every instance is termed a shock, yet it is the one constant in our lives after birth.   I want to help change that.  I started a Facebook page on the second anniversary of Peyton’s death titled “Until Death Do We Part”. https://www.facebook.com/untildeathdowe \n My goal is to change public knowledge, attitudes and behavior towards dying, death and bereavement through open communications and shared experience.  I plan for this to be a repository for information and an open forum for discussion.  \nYou probably will not want to visit this page today, tomorrow or even this year.  Just know it is there if you need help or a place to talk.\n\n",
