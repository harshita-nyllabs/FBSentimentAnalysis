When I called to find out what happened to my money you could not answer my questions but agreed to send the itemized statement that I requested for my account. This was a week ago, and I was told the cash value was $200.00. After 18 years. I could have thrown my money out my front window an gotten a better return, as at least some of it would have stuck to my lawn. As I am trying to figure out the foreign language of insurance in all the paperwork you have sent me, today you sent another letter stating you cancelled my policy and there is no insurance or cash value. Thank you for siphoning off the last $200.00 of my policy. My agent does not ever answer his phone. Your latest letter says to call the customer service number with questions, but goes directly to an automated system. We will talk again New York Life, but this time I will have legal representation.","from":{"name":"Jackie Johnson VanNorman","id":"10206449609060935"}},{"id":"113373749451_10154246410424452","status_type":"shared_story","message":"When is the best time to discuss financial matters with your family?
